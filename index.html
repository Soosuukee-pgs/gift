        <li>So I guess this is time</li>
        <li>I'm lowkey scared cause it has been time</li>
        <li>Time that did let it go what was in my mind</li>
        <li>But I guess for today I should probably try</li>

        <li>19 years that you have been blessing people's lives</li>
        <li>19 years of joy and life that endlessly thrives</li>
        <li>19 years of greatness, lighting up our lives</li>
        <li>19 years of laughter, where joy always strives</li>

        <li>I really wish I knew you earlier</li>
        <li>Your presence in life makes everything cheerier</li>
        <li>When we‚Äôre talking, my nights become much brighter</li>
        <li>I hope I'll have the chance to know you better</li>

        <li>I like the way you piss me off trying to be funny</li>
        <li>The way you're trying your best to get naughty</li>
        <li>
          The way I'm trying my best to not let you know that I'm heavily sleepy
        </li>
        <li>
          If I'm being honest, I can say that spending time with you always
          makes me happy
        </li>

        <li>But I'm still human, so sometimes I'm scared</li>
        <li>Thousands of questions popping up in my head</li>

        <li>"Does she really enjoy my company or is she just bored?"</li>
        <li>"Maybe it's just a game for her and I'm getting outplayed"</li>
        <li>"If I make a step back, will she feel the silence I've made,</li>
        <li>Or will I be forgotten, like a debt already paid?"</li>

        <li>But it's too late, I'm already addicted to seeing her smiling</li>
        <li>She's a mystery unfolding, a story worth chasing</li>
        <li>I feel like I'm Gol.D Roger when she's slowly opening</li>
        <li>I feel like I'm soaring, with no fear of crashing</li>

        <li>Kylie, I just wanted you to know</li>
        <li>Your touch is the warmth that melts all the snow</li>
        <li>Your eyes are the stars that guide where I go</li>
        <li>And your smile‚Äôs like a sunrise, setting my soul aglow</li>

        <li>To keep it shining, you have no idea</li>
        <li>I could go as far as Obito when it came to Rin</li>
        <li>No matter the darkness, no matter the sin</li>
        <li>I‚Äôd rewrite the story just to see you win</li>

        <li>I'm feeling blessed that I had to know you</li>
        <li>I'm losing all my manners, feeling as numb as Majin Buu</li>
        <li>You‚Äôre stuck in my mind, like a song I can‚Äôt undo</li>
        <li>And I‚Äôd tear through the world just to stand next to you</li>

        <li>Kylie, you‚Äôre the calm when my thoughts go astray</li>
        <li>A melody in my head that i hope will never decay.</li>
        <li>You‚Äôre the dream that i think everybody should chase</li>
        <li>
